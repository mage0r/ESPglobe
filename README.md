ESPglobe - A breakoutboard to drive neopixels
=============

Continuing in the tradition of poorly named projects, these circuits were originally designed for a mates light globe replacement.

Basically, this circuit board drives a neopixel using an ESP-01.  Sort of a cheap, RGB light really.
It takes a 5 volt input voltage and even uses a mosfet to ensure that you can drive them at full force.

You'll need another device to program your ESP-01.  Might I suggest https://github.com/mage0r/ESPkit-01/
